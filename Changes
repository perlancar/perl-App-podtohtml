	- [ux] Replace perl_modname_or_filename schema with the newer
	  perl::pod_or_pm_filename which will do the coercion of Foo::Bar
	  to filesystem path for us automatically, and will more
	  appropriately prioritize .pod over .pm (so e.g. podtohtml Rinci
	  will work and process Rinci.pod even though Rinci.pm also
	  exists).
